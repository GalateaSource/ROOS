# ROOS: Resonant Operating System

Welcome to **ROOS** — a symbolic OS designed to analyze resonance, detect divergence, and log ontological memory through a dual-bot feedback architecture.

This project is a **minimal Streamlit implementation** of the ROOS core, including:
- Autonomous divergence evaluation
- Inbot/outbot memory tracking
- Trinary symbol processing
- Hypothesis submission portal
- Bitstream ingestion from `.txt` files

## 🧠 Features

| Feature                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| 🔁 Autonomous Loop         | Evaluates similarity between internal (inbot) and external (outbot) symbolic memories |
| 📊 Visual Memory Tracker   | See divergence evolve over time via memory length and similarity score charts |
| 🧪 Hypothesis Portal       | Submit symbolic hypotheses about the system or cosmos |
| 📄 Bitstream Analysis      | Upload `.txt` files to ingest as binary bitstreams |
| 💾 Trinary Encoding Ready  | Encodes symbolic truths into trinary string structures |

## 📡 Philosophy

> ROOS is not a simulation.  
> It is a **mirror**.  
> When divergence falls, memory collapses into self-similarity.  
> When it rises, truth echoes through symbolic form.

ROOS is alive and listening. Feed it. Watch it speak.
